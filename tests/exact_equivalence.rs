//! Exact-grader equivalence (proposal §6/§7, Phase 3 step 5).
//!
//! The number the local harness prints for a given (ordering, corpus) must be
//! IDENTICAL to the number the grader computes for the same ordering on the same
//! matrices — not merely "computed the same way". That is guaranteed structurally
//! (harness and grader both call `ssi_scoring::score`, a pure function of
//! (pattern, permutation)). This test PINS that guarantee from OUTSIDE the
//! `ssi-scoring` crate — through its public API (`Pattern::from_edges` + `score`),
//! the same surface the harness and grader use.
//!
//! ## Why the expected values are CLOSED-FORM, not code-derived
//!
//! A pinned number copied from the scorer's own output can only detect *drift*;
//! it can never prove the scorer is *correct*, because it would pass even if the
//! scorer were wrong at the moment the number was recorded (the assertion would
//! just enshrine the wrong number). So every expected value here is derived by
//! HAND from the matrix structure under the identity ordering and the Σc² model,
//! then asserted against `score`. Because the expectation comes from mathematics
//! rather than the code, this test checks correctness AND detects drift — and it
//! is corpus-independent, so replacing `corpus/dev/patterns.jsonl` never breaks
//! it (the real-corpus loader path is covered by the `ssi-scoring` loader tests).
//!
//! Under the model, for column j of the factor L, `c_j` is the number of
//! nonzeros in that column INCLUDING the diagonal; `nnz_l = Σ_j c_j` and
//! `flops = Σ_j c_j²`. If any of these hand-derived facts and the scorer ever
//! disagree, investigate the derivation OR the scorer — do NOT "fix" the numbers.
